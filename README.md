<strong>Technologies Used:</strong></br>
-Languages: Java, HTML / JSX, CSS</br>
-Frameworks: Spring MVC</br>
-Database: MySQL</br>

<strong>Process:</strong></br>
-Beginning with the back-end, used MySQL Workbench to create an Entity Relationship Diagram.</br>
-Using Spring MVC's Object Relational Mapper, built the schema based on my ERD.</br>
-Created Repositories and Services to handle CRUD operations requested by the front-end.</br>
-Implemented Main Controller logic and setup routes to serve dynamic content to the front-end.</br>
-Created dynamic front-end templates using JSP.</br>
-Implemented styling with CSS, using Grid and media queries to make the website adapt to all screen sizes.</br>

<strong>What I Learned:</strong></br>
-A small group of my classmates were interested in contributing to my project, and I had an opportunity to teach them to use git and GitHub. This allowed me to learn how to better utilize this powerful tool for version control, and gain experience collaborating with a team.</br>
-Expanded my knowledge of CSS and CSS Grid through using a mobile-first design philosophy.</br>
-Gained a fundemental understanding of the Java programming language. As the other two languages I had learned were JavaScript and Python, 
learning a strongly typed language also helped strengthen my understanding of the fundamentals shared between all languages.</br>
